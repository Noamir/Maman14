Hi there!
It's almost the last time for this course (we have 1 more after this one (; )

As always, I attached the .pdf file explaining the tasks.

This time, it's 1 class, with 4 static methods.
Each one is separated and stands for it's own.

Please see Ex14 as main project, it contains all methods.
Other classes are tests.

Thanks!!
